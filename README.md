# .NET Core REST Api for Role Playing Game(rpg)
## Installation

If you wanna try run quickly this project from your local:
- Clone this repo
- Run `dotnet restore` to update packages dependencies
- Set user-secrets for secret key database
  ```s
  dotnet user-secrets init
  dotnet user-secrets set "AppSettings:Token" "< any secret key for jsonwebtoken>"
  ```
- Change name & password for connectionString of PostgreSQL in `appSettings.json`
  ```json
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost; Port=5432; Database=net_todo; User ID=postgres; Password=postgres"
  }
  ```
- Run database seeding
  ```s
  dotnet tool install -g dotnet-ef
  dotnet ef database update
  dotnet run
  ```
- Run `dotnet run`: to run server (check on port 5000)

Note: In this project, I use .Net version `3.1.3` and `5.0`. If you don't use these versions. You can use your own version by change version in `global.json` file and specify it in `.csproj` file: `<TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>`.
## Development

- With this project, you can understand:
  - How to build a web REST API with .net core 3 or  5
  - How to have a good structure project for web api
  - Use SQL Database & Entity Framework
  - Secure app & authenticate with JsonWebToken
  - OOP Solution 
  - Map & convert quickly between different classes
  - How to create document API with Swagger/Open API
  - Use Dependency Injection solution
  - How to access User from `HttpContextAccessor`
  - How to use asynchronously development solution for your project
  - Use Generic type
  

### Technologies
- Dotnet web api
- Authentication user: Using `System.Security.Cryptography` algorithms to create password `hash` & `salt` to save in database.
- Database: using `PostgreSQL` & Microsoft Entity Framework
- Authentication HTTP request with Json Web Token
- AutoMapper data between `data models` &  `data transfer object`
- Documentation: Using `Swashbuckle` of swagger to generate auto document api for view controller.

### Structure folder

- **Controllers**: contains all view controllers of project (routes, http request)
- **Data**: contains DataContext of Entity Framework Database
- **Dto**: Data Transfer Objects - Classes used as a container to encapsulate data and pass it from one layer of the application to another. We usually use them for working with http request.
- **Migrations**: Folders generate auto by [ef tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet) to create migrations with sql database (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server ...)
- **Models**: Class models contain fields of database tables
- **Services**: All services of project. Each service is equivalent the controller. It contains all methods using for controller.
- **Utilities**: Helper methods
- All other files: Generate auto with `dotnet new` tool.
  

### Branches
- I follow the principle development given by [Patrick God](https://dev.to/_patrickgod) and I try my own to code solution project.

  Thanks so much of his contribution. The series of this development are posted on [dev.to](https://dev.to/_patrickgod/net-core-3-1-web-api-entity-framework-jumpstart-part-1-4jla). 

The project is developed step by step from basics to advance.

Each branch is equivalent to each step. The master branch is the last solution of project. The template project is generated by `dotnet new webapi -o <...>`

Step by step:

- s1: Basic setup & Init  project with Entity Framework
- s2: Routing & Http request
- s3: Using asynchronous call
- s4: Using Data transfer object (DTO)
- s5: Object relation mapping & Migration with SQL database
- s6: CRUD with Entity Framework
- s7: Basic authentication
- s8: Authentication with JsonWebToken
- s9: Init relationship between models
- s10: One to one relationship
- s11: One to many relationship
- s12: Create Fight Classes for game
- s14: User role
- s15: Create seeding for Init database
- s16: More: Skill routing
- s17: More: User routing
- s18: Deploy to heroku
- Master branch: Last solution
- Upgrade-net50 branch: Using .Net 5.0
