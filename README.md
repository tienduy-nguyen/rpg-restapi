# .NET Core REST Api for Role Playing Game(rpg)
## Installation

If you wanna try run quickly this project from your local:
- Clone this repo
- Run `dotnet restore` to update packages dependencies
- Run `dotnet run`: to run server (check on port 5000)

Note: In this project, I use .Net version `3.1.3` and `5.0`. If you don't use these versions. You can use your own version by change version in `global.json` file and specify it in `.csproj` file: `<TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>`.
## Development

- I follow the principle development given by [Patrick God](https://dev.to/_patrickgod) and I try my own to code solution project.

  Thanks so much of his contribution. The series of this development are posted on [dev.to](https://dev.to/_patrickgod/net-core-3-1-web-api-entity-framework-jumpstart-part-1-4jla). 


- The project is developed step by step from basics to advance.

- Each branch is equivalent to each step. The master branch is the last solution of project. The template project is generated by `dotnet new webapi -o <...>`

- With this project, you can understand:
  - How to build a web REST API with .net core 3 or  5
  - How to have a good structure project for web api
  - Use SQL Database & Entity Framework
  - Secure app & authenticate with JsonWebToken
  - OOP Solution 
  - Map & convert quickly between different classes
  - How to create document API with Swagger/Open API
  - Use Dependency Injection solution
  - How to access User from `HttpContextAccessor`
  - How to use asynchronously development solution for your project
  - Use Generic type
  


### Technologies
- Dotnet web api
- Authentication user: Using `System.Security.Cryptography` algorithms to create password `hash` & `salt` to save in database.
- Database: using `PostgreSQL` & Microsoft Entity Framework
- Authentication HTTP request with Json Web Token
- AutoMapper data between `data models` &  `data transfer object`
- Documentation: Using `Swashbuckle` of swagger to generate auto document api for view controller.

### Structure folder

- **Controllers**: contains all view controllers of project (routes, http request)
- **Data**: contains DataContext of Entity Framework Database
- **Dto**: Data Transfer Objects - Classes used as a container to encapsulate data and pass it from one layer of the application to another. We usually use them for working with http request.
- **Migrations**: Folders generate auto by [ef tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet) to create migrations with sql database (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server ...)
- **Models**: Class models contain fields of database tables
- **Services**: All services of project. Each service is equivalent the controller. It contains all methods using for controller.
- **Utilities**: Helper methods
- All other files: Generate auto with `dotnet new` tool.
