# .NET Core REST Api for Role Playing Game(rpg)
## Installation

If you wanna try run quickly this project from your local:
- Clone this repo
- Run `dotnet restore` to update packages dependencies
- Run `dotnet run`: to run server (check on port 5000)

Note: In this project, I use .Net version `3.1.3` and `5.0`. If you don't use these versions. You can use your own version by change version in `global.json` file and specify it in `.csproj` file: `<TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>`.
## Development

I follow the principle development given by [Patrick God](https://dev.to/_patrickgod) and I try code my own solution.

Thanks so much of his contribution. The series of this development are posted on [dev.to](https://dev.to/_patrickgod/net-core-3-1-web-api-entity-framework-jumpstart-part-1-4jla). 

The project is developed step by step from basics to advance.

Each branch is equivalent to each step. The master branch is the last solution of project. The template project is generated by `dotnet new webapi -o <...>`

### Technologies
- Dotnet web api
- Authentication user: Using `System.Security.Cryptography` algorithms to create password `hash` & `salt` to save in database.
- Database: using `PostgreSQL` & Microsoft Entity Framework
- Authentication HTTP request with Json Web Token
- AutoMapper data between `data models` &  `data transfer object`
- Documentation: Using `Swashbuckle` of swagger to generate auto document api for view controller.

### Structure folder

- **Controllers**: contains all view controllers of project (routes, http request)
- **Data**: contains DataContext of Entity Framework Database
- **Dto**: Data Transfer Objects - Classes used as a container to encapsulate data and pass it from one layer of the application to another. We usually use them for working with http request.
- **Migrations**: Folders generate auto by [ef tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet) to create migrations with sql database (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server ...)
- **Models**: Class models contain fields of database tables
- **Services**: All services of project. Each service is equivalent the controller. It contains all methods using for controller.
- **Utilities**: Helper methods
- All other files: Generate auto with `dotnet new` tool.
